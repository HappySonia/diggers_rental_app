# diggers_rental_app

This project allows users to check weather that links weather information from openweather API.and also allows users to add diggers,edit diggers,delete diggers then submit rental order. 

## My plan/approach
add app functions and api work. 

## Cool tech that I used
Sessions for logged_in and BCrypt for password_digest. 
nested  API.

## Lessons you learned
after store apikey in zshrc, we need to close and restart terminal totally ,not only exit by control+C.

## Features to add in the future
change the user's input to users' choice.
